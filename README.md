# performance_monitor
Performance monitoring using React, Clustering, Redis and etc.
The idea is to monitor endpoints 

# Tech Stack:
* Clustring with node.js (spawining workers)
* Socket.io for handling data transportation
* Using Redis cache memory as an adapter between the socket connection to the worker
* Using React as client side for showing the widgets that represent the monitoring
* Creating super cool sticky connection
